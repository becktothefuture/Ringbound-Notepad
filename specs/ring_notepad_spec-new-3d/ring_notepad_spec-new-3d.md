Technical Specification: 3D Rolodex Interface with Three.js CSS3DRenderer

Introduction and Overview

This document specifies the design and implementation of a 3D Rolodex-style interface using Three.js and its CSS3DRenderer. The goal is to replace an existing flat, DOM-based scrollable Rolodex with a full 3D experience while preserving the original look-and-feel and scroll interactions. Users will still scroll the page natively (using the browser’s scrollbar or touch scroll), but instead of a flat list, the content pages will flip in 3D as if on a Rolodex stack. Importantly, the solution will use Three.js’s CSS3DRenderer so that each page remains a live DOM element (supporting videos, images, and user interaction), rendered in 3D space.

Key requirements and goals:
	•	Full 3D Page Flip Effect: Pages should appear as a flat stack of cards in 3D, flipping over one another (along a horizontal axis like a hinged stack) as the user scrolls. This is a linear stack (not a cylindrical carousel), preserving the flat Rolodex-style flipping.
	•	Preserve Original Layout and Scroll Behaviour: The 3D Rolodex should retain the positioning and flow of the original DOM version. Scrolling uses the native browser scroll (no custom scroll emulation), ensuring normal scroll inertia and accessibility.
	•	DOM Elements as Pages: Each page’s content is a regular DOM element (could contain text, images, video, forms, etc.) that is mapped onto a 3D plane via CSS3DRenderer. This allows interactive elements (links, buttons, video controls) to function normally in 3D space.
	•	Dynamic Content Support: Pages can have dynamic or rich content. The 3D system must handle content that loads or changes (e.g. images loading, videos, or interactive embeds) without breaking layout or scroll.
	•	Performance and Responsiveness: The interface should run smoothly (60fps where possible). It must handle window resizes and different screen sizes gracefully, adjusting the 3D layout to maintain the correct appearance and enabling responsive design for the page content.

This specification includes a setup guide for the development environment, a breakdown of the system’s architecture and components, a sample implementation outline (with code snippets), and notes on performance considerations and edge cases.

Development Environment Setup

To implement the 3D Rolodex interface, a modern JavaScript development environment with a bundler is recommended. Below is a step-by-step guide to set up the project with Three.js and the CSS3DRenderer addon:
	1.	Project Initialization: Ensure you have Node.js (with npm or Yarn) installed. Create a new project directory and initialise it. For example:

mkdir three-rolodex && cd three-rolodex
npm init -y

This will create a package.json with default settings.

	2.	Install Three.js: Use npm to install the latest Three.js library. This will include the core Three.js and example addons (like CSS3DRenderer). For example:

npm install three

This pulls in Three.js r<latest> (as of 2025) which supports ES modules.

	3.	Choose a Bundler/Build Tool: Select a modern bundler or dev server to handle module imports and live reloading. You can use tools like Vite, Webpack, or Parcel. For simplicity, this spec will assume Vite (which requires minimal config):

npm install --save-dev vite

You can then add a script in package.json to start Vite, e.g. "dev": "vite".

	4.	Project Structure: Create an index.html for the page and a src/main.js (or .ts if using TypeScript) for your code. In index.html, include a script tag of type module to your main file if not using an automatic bundler entry. For example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <title>3D Rolodex</title>
  <style>
    /* Basic styles to ensure body and html take full height */
    html, body { margin: 0; padding: 0; height: 100%; overflow: auto; }
    body { background: #000; /* example background */ }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- The Three.js scene will be injected here -->
  <div id="three-container"></div>
  <script type="module" src="/src/main.js"></script>
</body>
</html>


	5.	Import Three.js and CSS3DRenderer: In your main.js, import the necessary classes from Three.js. The CSS3DRenderer is an addon and must be imported from the examples directory. For example:

import * as THREE from 'three';
import { CSS3DRenderer, CSS3DObject } from 'three/examples/jsm/renderers/CSS3DRenderer.js';

(If using TypeScript, install @types/three for Three.js type definitions. The CSS3DRenderer classes might need manual type definitions if not included by default.)

	6.	Dev Server: Start the development server (e.g. run npm run dev if using Vite as configured). You should now have a basic page served locally, ready for adding the 3D Rolodex code.

Note: The CSS3DRenderer is essentially a custom renderer that outputs an HTML <div> containing your transformed DOM elements. It’s not part of the core Three.js WebGLRenderer; it must be explicitly imported as above ￼. This renderer uses CSS 3D transforms under the hood, so our pages will be styled via CSS matrices. Keep in mind that CSS3DRenderer doesn’t support Three.js materials or geometries – it’s purely for positioning DOM elements in 3D space ￼. We will rely on this to embed real DOM content into our scene.

Architecture and Design Rationale

The system will consist of a Three.js scene that renders two layers: a CSS3D layer for the flipping pages (and optionally a WebGL layer if needed for extra effects, though not required for core functionality). The architecture is designed to clearly separate content (DOM pages) from presentation (3D scene), while leveraging native browser scrolling.

Key architectural choices:
	•	CSS3DRenderer for DOM Pages: We use Three.js’s CSS3DRenderer so that each Rolodex page is a live DOM element rendered in 3D. This allows us to include rich content (images, video, iframes, interactive forms) as-is, with normal CSS styling and events. Using CSS3D means we avoid converting DOM to textures or canvases – instead, each page is a <div> that Three.js positions via CSS transforms ￼. This preserves full interactivity (e.g. you can click links or play videos on the pages in 3D space).
	•	Preserving Native Scrolling: The browser’s native scroll drives the interface. We do not replace the scroll bar or wheel handling with a custom mechanism. Instead, we will listen to the window’s scroll events (or use an onScroll callback) and update the 3D scene accordingly. This way, users still experience the familiar momentum and accessibility of normal scrolling. The 3D scene will be essentially tied to the scroll position.
	•	Fixed 3D Viewport Overlay: The Three.js scene will be rendered in a container that overlays the viewport, typically positioned fixed covering the entire screen. This container will be transparent and allow pointer events to reach the page content elements. By overlaying a fixed container, the 3D scene always fills the screen while the user scrolls the page behind it. In practice, we will append CSS3DRenderer.domElement to a container (like the #three-container in the HTML above) and style it to cover the viewport. The underlying page (for scroll) will have a height equal to the total scrollable content (see Scroll Layout below).
	•	Scroll Layout vs. 3D Transform: We will manage the apparent vertical movement of content by adjusting the 3D camera or the scene objects in response to scroll. Two approaches are possible:
	•	Moving Camera: As the user scrolls, we move the Three.js camera up/down (along the Y axis) to mimic moving down a list of pages.
	•	Moving Objects: Alternatively, keep the camera fixed and translate the 3D objects in the opposite direction (moving the page group upward as scroll increases).
In this design, we will use a fixed camera and move the objects (pages) within a parent “scroll group”. This approach is straightforward: the scroll value directly offsets the group position, creating a correspondence between scroll distance and 3D movement. The result is identical to moving the camera, but it simplifies keeping the camera’s orientation constant.
	•	Coordinate System: The 3D coordinate system will be set such that the Y-axis is used for vertical placement of pages (similar to DOM flow vertically). We’ll treat Y=0 as a baseline (likely corresponding to the bottom of the first page when it is fully in view). Positive Y will go upwards. The camera will look toward the pages along the negative Z axis. Each page (CSS3DObject) will be positioned at a certain Y coordinate in the scene corresponding to its position in the scroll stack. For example, page 0 might be at y = 0, page 1 at y = -H (where H is the vertical spacing, probably equal to the page height), page 2 at y = -2H, and so on. As scroll progresses (scrollY increases), the entire group of pages will move up (in +Y direction) to simulate the camera moving down the list.
	•	Page Pivot for Flipping: To achieve the flip animation, each page will rotate around its bottom edge (as if pages are hinged at the bottom, flipping forward and backward). We will set the CSS transform origin of each page element to its bottom center (e.g. transform-origin: 50% 100%) so that rotations around the X-axis occur around the bottom edge. This avoids needing a separate pivot Object3D for each page – the CSS3DObject will rotate in place around the bottom border.
	•	Perspective Camera Setup: A perspective camera will provide depth and a subtle foreshortening effect during flips. We will configure the camera’s field of view (FOV) and distance so that a page at the center of view appears at the correct size. For example, if each page is roughly viewport-sized (say width = viewport width, height = viewport height), we will position the camera such that when a page is facing the camera at z=0, it fills most of the viewport. This might involve some tweaking of FOV or camera distance. A typical setup could be:
	•	FOV ~ 45–60° (adjust as needed so that one page fits nicely in view with maybe a small margin).
	•	Camera positioned at a certain Z (e.g. camera.position.z = distance) looking at the origin. The distance can be computed from FOV and desired framing (for instance, distance = (pageHeight/2) / tan(FOV/2) to match the vertical size).
	•	The camera’s up direction is Y, and it looks toward negative Z (the default in Three.js). This means a page with no rotation, placed at z=0 and appropriate y offset, will face the camera.
	•	Renderer Order: Since we are only using CSS3DRenderer for main content, we don’t have the complexity of mixing WebGL objects behind/through CSS. (If in the future a WebGLRenderer is added for background or extra 3D effects, note that CSS3DRenderer’s DOM will overlay on top of the canvas by design ￼. For now, we assume all visible 3D elements are CSS DOM elements which naturally stack as per DOM order.)

By using CSS3DObjects for pages, we ensure each page’s internal layout and styling can be done with standard CSS. However, the placement of pages in 3D (their positions and rotations in the scene) will be controlled via Three.js JavaScript logic – we cannot rely on CSS layout for positioning in 3D space ￼. Each page element might use CSS internally (e.g. a video player’s CSS, text styling, etc.), but the overall page’s transform is set by our Three.js scene configuration.

Component Breakdown

Below is a breakdown of the main components and objects involved in the 3D Rolodex system:
	•	Three.js Scene (THREE.Scene): The root container for our 3D content. We will create one scene to hold all page objects. (If combining with WebGL, we’d have one scene for CSS3D and possibly another for WebGL content; in our case one scene is sufficient since we’re only dealing with CSS3DObjects.)
	•	Camera (THREE.PerspectiveCamera): A perspective camera that views the scene. For example, we might use:

const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(fov, aspect, near, far);
camera.position.set(0, cameraY, cameraZ);
camera.lookAt(new THREE.Vector3(0, cameraY, 0));

The camera will likely be positioned looking at the center of the current page. We may adjust cameraY or angle if needed so that it’s looking slightly down or directly at the center of pages. (Often you’d keep camera.position.y = 0 and move the scroll group, or move camera’s y to simulate scroll.)

	•	CSS3DRenderer: This renderer will create a DOM element that houses the transformed DOM pages. We will initialise it and attach it to our container. For example:

const cssRenderer = new CSS3DRenderer();
cssRenderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
document.getElementById('three-container').appendChild(cssRenderer.domElement);
cssRenderer.domElement.style.position = 'fixed';  // make sure it stays in place
cssRenderer.domElement.style.top = '0';
cssRenderer.domElement.style.left = '0';
cssRenderer.domElement.style.zIndex = '0';        // behind any overlay UI if needed
cssRenderer.domElement.style.pointerEvents = 'none'; // allow underlying page interactions where no content (we'll override for actual content elements)

Here we set pointer-events: none on the renderer’s main container so it doesn’t block scroll or clicks except where our page elements reside. We will ensure each page element can receive pointer events (their default, or explicitly pointer-events: auto on those elements). This way, scrolling on blank areas and interactions on content both work. (Note: If we find that the CSS3DRenderer or its elements have pointer-events: none by default, we’ll adjust accordingly. One forum note suggests checking this if scroll on content isn’t working ￼.)

	•	Scroll Container / Placeholder: To preserve native scroll, the HTML document (or a specific scroll container div) will maintain a height equal to the total content. Since our actual content is being taken out of normal flow (to place in 3D), we need a placeholder to make the page scrollable. We will likely create a transparent container that has the same total height as all pages stacked flat. For example, if there are N pages and each is approximately viewport height, the total scrollable height might be N * window.innerHeight. We can insert an element (e.g. a <div id="scrollSpacer" style="height: N*100vh"></div>) in the DOM behind the CSS3DRenderer container. This scrollSpacer ensures the browser’s scrollbar reflects the correct range. The Three.js scene will be updated based on window.scrollY, but the actual content seen is via the CSS3DRenderer overlay.
	•	Page Elements (DOM): These are the actual content containers for each Rolodex “page”. In the HTML, you might have something like:

<div class="rolodex-page" id="page1"> ... content ... </div>
<div class="rolodex-page" id="page2"> ... content ... </div>
<!-- etc. -->

Each .rolodex-page will be taken and turned into a CSS3DObject. We should give these pages consistent dimensions (e.g. using CSS to set their width to 100% of container and a min-height of 100vh for full-screen pages). We will also set their transform origin to bottom-center in CSS:

.rolodex-page {
  transform-origin: 50% 100%;
  /* Other styling like background, text styles etc. */
}

Setting the transform origin ensures that when Three.js rotates the element in 3D, it pivots around the bottom edge (the “hinge”). Also, to make back-face of pages invisible (in case of any flip beyond 90°), we can apply backface-visibility: hidden; transform-style: preserve-3d; to these elements. This prevents mirrored content showing on the reverse when a page flips away.

	•	Page Objects (THREE.CSS3DObject): For each DOM page element, we create a CSS3DObject and add it to the scene (likely as a child of a scroll Group – see next). Example:

const pageEl = document.getElementById('page1');
const pageObject = new CSS3DObject(pageEl);
pageObject.position.set(0, 0, 0);
scene.add(pageObject);

By adding the actual DOM element to the CSS3DObject, it is removed from the regular document flow and now managed by Three.js. We’ll do this for each page. Initially, we set their positions in the scene stacked along Y (e.g. page0 at y=0, page1 at y=-height, etc.). The position coordinates will likely be in Three.js world units – we can define 1 unit = 1 pixel for simplicity by aligning the camera accordingly. Alternatively, we might compute positions dynamically based on element offsetHeight.

	•	Scroll Group (THREE.Group): To simplify moving all pages together, we will create a parent Group and add all page CSS3DObjects to this group. Then, instead of adjusting each page for scroll, we can simply set scrollGroup.position.y = scrollY (or a scaled variant) on each frame. For example:

const scrollGroup = new THREE.Group();
scene.add(scrollGroup);
// for each pageObject:
scrollGroup.add(pageObject);
pageObject.position.y = -pageHeight * index;

Now all pages are children of scrollGroup, which itself is at y=0 initially. As the user scrolls down, we increment scrollGroup.position.y, effectively raising all pages up and causing the next pages to move into the camera’s view. This mirrors how in a normal scroll, content moves upward.

	•	Animation/Scroll Controller: This isn’t a concrete object, but rather logic to tie scroll events to 3D updates. We will use either an event listener on window.scroll or a requestAnimationFrame loop that checks window.scrollY. This controller will determine how far to rotate each page based on the scroll position.

3D Page Flipping Mechanics

The core visual effect is pages flipping in 3D as the user scrolls. This requires coordinating the translation (movement) and rotation of pages in response to scroll position. We want the transition from one page to the next to feel like the top page is flipping away to reveal the next page underneath, in a realistic, stack-like fashion.

Approach to flipping:
	•	Each page will flip around its bottom edge. At the moment when a page is fully in view (occupying the screen), it should be perpendicular to the camera (i.e. not tilted – rotation X = 0). As the user scrolls further down, the current page will start to rotate forward (downwards), as if the bottom edge is fixed and the top is tipping away from the viewer. Simultaneously, the next page (which was initially underneath) will start to rotate from a flat position up into view.
	•	We can define a scroll interval (range) during which the transition between page i and page i+1 occurs. If pages are all roughly the height of the viewport, a logical interval is the scroll distance of one page (e.g. from scrollY = i * H to scrollY = (i+1) * H, where H is page height). Within that interval, page i goes from 0° to +90° rotated (tipping forward), and page i+1 goes from -90° (lying flat, facing upward) to 0° (upright).
	•	Initial configuration for pages: We will initially position the first page upright (rotationX = 0). The second page, however, should initially be out of view, ready to come in. One way is to start the second page at 90° backward tilt (i.e. rotated -90° around X-axis, so it lies flat, facing upward towards the camera). But if it’s directly underneath the first page, we won’t see it because the first page covers it. That’s fine – as the first page flips forward, the second one will start rotating up.
	•	Alternatively, we could start the next page slightly rotated already or slightly offset in Z to avoid perfect overlap, but if perfectly overlapping, the first page will cover it until it tilts.
	•	During scroll transition: As scroll progresses from page i to i+1, we interpolate the rotations:
	•	Page i (outgoing page): rotationX from 0° to +90° (assuming positive rotationX means tilting forward, top going away from camera). By 90°, the page is flat (horizontal), likely out of sight or edge-on to camera.
	•	Page i+1 (incoming page): rotationX from -90° to 0° over the same scroll interval. At -90° it was flat (lying facing upward, effectively not visible to the camera which is in front), and at 0° it stands upright facing the camera.
	•	Flat stack structure: The “flat, stack-based” phrasing implies that pages are not arranged in a ring or circle, but one directly behind the other. In our setup, when one page is upright, the others behind it might be either flat or tilted, but all share the same hinge line at the bottom. We are not spinning a carousel; we are flipping through a linear stack.
	•	Continuous vs Stepwise flip: The flipping should feel continuous with scroll. That means we map the scroll position proportionally to rotation angles. We might implement this by computing a progress fraction for the current page transition. For example:
If scrollY is between i*H and (i+1)*H, define t = (scrollY - i*H) / H (ranges 0 to 1). Then:
	•	page[i].rotation.x = t * (Math.PI/2) (i.e. 0 to 90° in radians)
	•	page[i+1].rotation.x = - (Math.PI/2) * (1 - t) or simply - (Math.PI/2) + t * (Math.PI/2) (i.e. -90° at t=0, to 0° at t=1).
This ensures at t=0, page[i] is 0°, page[i+1] is -90°; at t=1, page[i] is 90°, page[i+1] is 0°. Intermediate values yield a smooth flip overlap.
	•	Movement during flip: In addition to rotation, we might need to adjust the position of pages slightly for realism. For instance, as page i flips away, its bottom edge might need to stay in place (on the hinge). Our setup of transform-origin at bottom should handle the rotation pivot correctly. However, if the camera perspective causes the flipping page to intersect or cover the next page oddly, we may consider moving the flipping page slightly in Z or Y to avoid z-fighting or overlapping visuals. Often, a slight offset in Z for pages “underneath” helps prevent them poking through. We can, for example, put each successive page a bit further back on the Z-axis (e.g. each page  position.z = index * -5 or some small offset) so that they physically stack with a tiny gap. This way, when one is flat, it sits just behind the other. The offset should be small enough not to be noticeable in the frontal view but just to establish draw order.
	•	Maintaining scroll position vs animation: Because we are not using a fake scroll, the scroll value will continuously change as the user scrolls. We will continuously update rotations accordingly. We won’t “snap” pages or freeze scrolling; the user can freely scroll at any speed, and the pages should interpolate to the appropriate angle. If the user scrolls very quickly, they might flip through multiple pages in a second – our code should handle that (likely by updating all affected pages’ rotations each frame).
	•	Entering/Leaving View: When a page has fully flipped out (90° or beyond), it should effectively be out of sight (either edge-on or oriented away). We can consider it non-interactive at that point. Conversely, the next page becomes interactive once it has largely flipped in. We might toggle pointer-events on pages based on their state: for instance, when a page is not the front-most (fully face-up) page, you might disable pointer events on it (so that clicking or scrolling doesn’t accidentally target a tilted page underneath). However, since the top page covers the screen when upright, it will naturally receive events. As it tilts, the next page comes in front. We just need to ensure a page that has tilted away doesn’t still capture clicks. Setting pointer-events: none on a page element once its rotation passes, say, 45° (halfway flipped out) and enabling on the next page might be prudent. This can be managed by adding/removing a CSS class or directly setting style in the scroll update logic.

Summary of Scroll-Flip Coordination: We maintain a mapping between window.scrollY and each page’s transform:
	•	Use a loop or calculation in the scroll handler to determine which two pages are in transition at any given scroll position (essentially floor and ceil of scrollY / H). Only those two pages will be mid-flip; others will be either fully unflipped (0°) or fully flipped (90°) out of view.
	•	For pages far above (scrolled past), we might keep them at 90° (or even 180° flipped completely and moved behind) so they are hidden. For pages not yet reached, we keep them at -90° (flat, waiting).
	•	Only the current and next page interpolate between -90° and 90°. This means at any scroll point, typically one page is partly out and the next partly in, while all others are either off-screen above or below.
	•	Edge case: At the very top (scrollY = 0), only the first page is in view (no previous page). We ensure page0 is at 0° (upright). At the very bottom (last page fully in view), there is no next page to flip in, so the last page simply stays upright once reached (we won’t flip it out because nothing comes after; or if we do flip it for a fancy “put it away” effect, that’s optional).

Implementation Guide (Step-by-Step)

In this section, we outline the steps to implement the interface, including initialising Three.js, setting up the scene and pages, and synchronising with scroll events. Code snippets are provided for clarity (assuming an ES6 environment with modules and a bundler as set up earlier).

1. Initialise Three.js Scene, Camera, and Renderer

First, set up the basic Three.js scene, perspective camera, and the CSS3DRenderer:

// Import Three.js and CSS3D classes at top of file
import * as THREE from 'three';
import { CSS3DRenderer, CSS3DObject } from 'three/examples/jsm/renderers/CSS3DRenderer.js';

// Create scene and camera
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const fov = 50;
const aspect = window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight;
const near = 0.1;
const far = 2000;
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(fov, aspect, near, far);
// Position camera so it looks at the center of the first page.
camera.position.set(0, 0, 800);  // distance may be adjusted based on page size
camera.lookAt(new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 0));

// Create CSS3DRenderer and attach to DOM
const cssRenderer = new CSS3DRenderer();
cssRenderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
const container = document.getElementById('three-container');
container.style.position = 'fixed';
container.style.top = '0'; container.style.left = '0';
container.style.width = '100%'; container.style.height = '100%';
container.style.pointerEvents = 'none';  // allow interactions to pass through by default
container.appendChild(cssRenderer.domElement);
cssRenderer.domElement.style.width = '100%';
cssRenderer.domElement.style.height = '100%';
cssRenderer.domElement.style.outline = 'none'; // remove any focus outlines if present

In the above:
	•	We positioned the camera at z=800 (this value might need tuning). The idea is to ensure a page covers most of the viewport width. For example, if a page element is ~1200px tall, an FOV of 50 and camera distance 800 might make it fit nicely. We can adjust after seeing the actual size.
	•	We set the container and renderer DOM element to fixed full-screen. We also set pointer-events: none on the container so that by default it doesn’t capture any mouse events. We will later set individual pages to pointer-events: auto so they can be interacted with. This way, any area not covered by a page acts like a transparent window allowing underlying page scrolling (though in our case, underlying page is mostly just the spacer).

2. Prepare and Add Page Elements to the Scene

Next, gather all the page DOM elements and convert them to CSS3DObjects. We also configure their initial positions and rotations:

// Assume our HTML has a container with all pages, e.g. <div id="pages"> containing child .rolodex-page elements.
const pageElements = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.rolodex-page'));
const scrollGroup = new THREE.Group();
scene.add(scrollGroup);

const pageHeight = window.innerHeight;  // assuming each page roughly one viewport tall; adjust if dynamic
pageElements.forEach((el, index) => {
  // Ensure transform origin is bottom-center for flipping
  el.style.transformOrigin = '50% 100%';
  el.style.backfaceVisibility = 'hidden';
  el.style.transformStyle = 'preserve-3d';
  // Allow this element to receive pointer events (override parent)
  el.style.pointerEvents = 'auto';

  // Create CSS3DObject and set its position
  const object = new CSS3DObject(el);
  object.position.x = 0;
  object.position.y = - pageHeight * index;  // stack pages downwards
  object.position.z = 0;
  object.rotation.x = 0;
  scrollGroup.add(object);
});

Explanations and assumptions in this snippet:
	•	We select all elements with class .rolodex-page in the DOM. These should correspond to individual page content containers.
	•	We explicitly set CSS properties:
	•	transformOrigin = '50% 100%' so that rotations happen around the bottom edge.
	•	backfaceVisibility = 'hidden' to not show the backside of pages when rotated.
	•	transformStyle = 'preserve-3d' to ensure the DOM element’s children (if any 3D transforms) are preserved in 3D space (mostly relevant if we nest 3D transforms, but good practice).
	•	pointerEvents = 'auto' because we set the parent container to none. This means the pages themselves will catch mouse/touch events normally.
	•	We create a Three.js Group called scrollGroup which will hold all page objects. This group’s collective position will be adjusted on scroll.
	•	We position each page object at y = - pageHeight * index. If pageHeight is viewport height (e.g. 800px), page0 at y=0, page1 at y=-800, page2 at y=-1600, etc. Given our camera and coordinate setup, this means page1 is initially one screen below page0, etc. When scrollGroup moves up by 800, page1 will come into the camera’s view position.
	•	We start all object.rotation.x = 0 for now. Alternatively, we might set all but the first to -Math.PI/2 (-90°) so that they start flat. However, it might be simpler to start them all at 0 and handle in scroll update (the effect of a page not yet visible can be achieved by it being off-screen anyway due to positioning).
	•	Option: For realism, we could set object.rotation.x = -Math.PI/2 for all pages with index > 0 (i.e. pages that are initially below the first) so they lie flat. The first page stays at 0. Then in scroll logic, we rotate them in as needed. This prevents any chance that a page below might peek out before being supposed to. But if they’re translated far down, the camera likely won’t see them until moved up, so either approach works.

At this point, our scene is set: we have a stack of page objects in a group, the camera looking at the top of the stack, and the CSS3DRenderer ready.

We should also set up an initial spacer in the DOM for scrolling. For example, after adding page elements to the scene, do:

// Add a scroll spacer to body for actual scrolling
const totalHeight = pageHeight * pageElements.length;
const spacer = document.createElement('div');
spacer.style.height = totalHeight + 'px';
spacer.style.pointerEvents = 'none';  // spacer just to push scroll, no interaction
document.body.appendChild(spacer);

This creates a tall empty div that ensures the page is scrollable for the full height of all pages. (If your existing DOM already accounts for this height, you might not need a new spacer. But typically, since we removed the page elements from flow into the 3D scene, we need to replace their space.)

3. Scroll Event Handling and Animation Loop

We need to tie the scrollGroup position and page rotations to the scroll position. We can use the onscroll event or a requestAnimationFrame loop to update on every frame. A pattern is to use requestAnimationFrame for smooth updates, reading window.scrollY.

For example:

let lastScrollY = window.scrollY;
function animate() {
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);

  // Check if camera or group needs update due to scroll
  const currentScroll = window.scrollY;
  if (currentScroll !== lastScrollY) {
    lastScrollY = currentScroll;
    // Move the scrollGroup to follow scroll (assuming 1px scroll = 1 unit in our 3D world)
    scrollGroup.position.y = currentScroll;
    // Update page rotations based on current scroll
    updatePageRotations(currentScroll);
  }

  // Render the scene from camera perspective
  cssRenderer.render(scene, camera);
}
animate();

Here we continuously render the scene. We only update positions/rotations when scrollY changes to optimize a bit. The scrollGroup.position.y = currentScroll ties the 3D content’s vertical position directly to scroll. If 1 CSS pixel corresponds to 1 Three.js unit, this keeps content aligned. (If scale differs, we’d multiply the scroll value by a factor to match the scene’s unit; but by setting camera and positions as we did, we try to keep them 1:1.)

Now, the core of the flip logic is in updatePageRotations(). We calculate how far along each page’s transition we are. For each page index i, we might want to know the relative scroll within that page’s interval:

function updatePageRotations(scrollY) {
  const pageH = pageHeight;  // shorthand
  pageElements.forEach((el, i) => {
    const pageObject = scrollGroup.children[i];  // corresponding CSS3DObject
    // Determine the scroll range for this page transition
    const start = i * pageH;
    const end = (i + 1) * pageH;
    if (scrollY >= start && scrollY < end) {
      // This is the active transition (page i is going out, page i+1 coming in)
      const t = (scrollY - start) / pageH;  // 0 to 1 progress
      // Rotate page i (current page) out
      pageObject.rotation.x = t * (Math.PI / 2);  // 0 -> 90deg
      // Next page coming in (i+1) if exists
      if (i + 1 < scrollGroup.children.length) {
        const nextPageObject = scrollGroup.children[i + 1];
        nextPageObject.rotation.x = - (Math.PI / 2) * (1 - t);  // -90 -> 0deg
      }
    } else if (scrollY < start) {
      // This page and beyond haven't been reached yet
      // Keep page upright if it's before the current scroll position (i.e., above in list)
      pageObject.rotation.x = 0;
      // If it's not the first page, maybe keep it flat? We'll handle below for ones below current view.
    } else if (scrollY >= end) {
      // This page has been scrolled past completely
      // If it's fully past, we can tilt it fully flat out of view
      pageObject.rotation.x = Math.PI / 2;  // 90 deg, flipped out
    }
  });
}

The above pseudocode covers the main idea:
	•	Identify which pair of pages are transitioning (the page that’s currently being scrolled out and the next page coming in). This is the page i such that i*pageH <= scrollY < (i+1)*pageH.
	•	Interpolate the rotation for page i and i+1 based on the fraction t. We rotate page i from 0 to 90° and page i+1 from -90° to 0.
	•	For pages that are beyond the current scroll (not yet reached), we might want them to start at -90° (flat, facing up). In the code, pages with scrollY < start would be those below the current section (since scrollY is still above their start). Actually, if scrollY is at page0, then for page1 (start=pageH) scrollY < start means page1 hasn’t been reached. We might set page1.rotation.x =  -90° in that case to hide it. So we can modify that branch:
	•	If scrollY < start (meaning page i is below the current view), we set rotation.x = -Math.PI/2 (flat, hidden).
	•	If scrollY >= end (page is above, already flipped away), set rotation.x = Math.PI/2 (flat, hidden above).
	•	If scrollY is in the middle of this page (meaning the user is currently reading page i fully and not yet transitioning), then we ensure page i is upright (rotation 0) and maybe page i+1 is still flat. This case happens when scrollY is between start and end but the conditional didn’t catch it because the code above only catches exactly in transition. Actually, if scrollY is between start and end, we consider that a transition is happening or about to happen. But consider if content of a page is taller than viewport and user is scrolling within it (in our assumption pageH = viewport, so not an issue; if it were bigger, we’d have to handle partial scroll on same page differently).
	•	We need to ensure we don’t double-rotate pages inadvertently if logic overlaps. The pseudo-code might be refined to clearly handle three zones for each page: above viewport (already flipped), in viewport, below viewport (not yet flipped in).

A refined approach:
	•	Determine current page index iCurr = Math.floor(scrollY / pageH) (which page number the top of viewport corresponds to).
	•	Determine progress t = (scrollY % pageH) / pageH (fraction through the current page’s scroll).
	•	For each page index j:
	•	If j < iCurr: This page is above the viewport (user scrolled past it). We set rotation.x = Math.PI/2 (flipped up, out of view).
	•	If j == iCurr: This page is the current top page. Two scenarios:
	•	If we are not yet transitioning to next (e.g. near the top of page), we might keep it mostly upright. But practically, as soon as scrollY moves, we are in a transition from j to j+1. So treat it as the outgoing page.
	•	For j == iCurr, set rotation.x = t * 90°.
	•	If j == iCurr + 1: This is the next page coming in. Set rotation.x = -90° + t * 90° (which at t=0 is -90, at t=1 is 0).
	•	If j > iCurr + 1: Pages further down (not reached yet) remain flat and hidden at -90°.
	•	Special case: The last page should probably never rotate out (because there’s no next page to reveal). Once scroll reaches the last page, we might keep it upright even if the user scrolls beyond its start (if there is some overscroll or additional blank space). In practice, our scrollable height might stop exactly at the last page’s top (so the last page becomes current and there’s no further scroll to rotate it out). We should ensure the spacer height ends such that last page’s top aligns with the top of viewport at maximum scroll, and the last page stays in view.

Let’s implement the rotation update with this logic:

function updatePageRotations(scrollY) {
  const pageH = pageHeight;
  const currentIndex = Math.floor(scrollY / pageH);
  let t = (scrollY % pageH) / pageH;
  if (t < 0) t = 0;
  if (t > 1) t = 1;
  
  pageElements.forEach((el, j) => {
    const pageObj = scrollGroup.children[j];
    if (j < currentIndex) {
      // Page is above (already flipped and out of view)
      pageObj.rotation.x = Math.PI / 2;
    } else if (j === currentIndex) {
      // Current page being flipped out
      pageObj.rotation.x = t * (Math.PI / 2);
    } else if (j === currentIndex + 1) {
      // Next page being flipped in
      pageObj.rotation.x = - Math.PI / 2 * (1 - t);
    } else {
      // Page is further below, not reached yet
      pageObj.rotation.x = - Math.PI / 2;
    }
  });
}

This ensures:
	•	All pages above the current one are at 90° (flipped up out of view).
	•	The current page and next page are somewhere between -90 and 90 depending on scroll progress.
	•	All pages below the next page are at -90° (flat, waiting).

We also should handle enabling/disabling pointer events for pages. We want only the mostly face-up page to be interactive (so that, for example, if a link on page underneath somehow is directly under a transparent part of current page, it’s not clickable until that page comes up). However, since each page is a separate DOM element and they do not overlap in screen space except during partial flip (where one’s top might be visible while previous is rotating out), there’s potential overlap. Typically, as one page rotates out, the other rotates in, they might overlap during the flip (one going from bottom, one from top). But because of perspective, it might not be a direct overlay; still, to be safe, we can disable pointer events on any page that is not nearly facing the user.

A simple rule: enable pointer events on the page if its rotation angle is < 45° from facing (i.e. if rotation.x < ~0.785 rad). Otherwise, disable. We can implement this in the loop:

pageObj.element.style.pointerEvents = (Math.abs(pageObj.rotation.x) < Math.PI/4) ? 'auto' : 'none';

This sets the DOM element’s pointer events. (Note: pageObj.element is the actual DOM element we gave to CSS3DObject.)

4. Final Touches: Resizing, Camera Adjustments, Styles

Handling Window Resize: We must update the renderer size and camera on window resize to maintain the effect and responsiveness:

window.addEventListener('resize', () => {
  // Update renderer size
  cssRenderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
  // Update camera aspect (if using perspective camera)
  camera.aspect = window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight;
  camera.updateProjectionMatrix();
  
  // If page height or layout depends on size, update measurements:
  pageHeight = window.innerHeight;
  // Update positions of pages based on new height
  scrollGroup.children.forEach((pageObj, idx) => {
    pageObj.position.y = - pageHeight * idx;
  });
  // Update scroll spacer height
  spacer.style.height = (pageHeight * pageElements.length) + 'px';
  // Recompute current scroll-based transforms (in case aspect change affects appearance)
  lastScrollY = -1; // force update
});

This ensures the 3D scene covers the new viewport and that our stacking of pages matches the new size. We recalc pageHeight and reposition all pages accordingly. We also adjust the total scrollable height. We flag lastScrollY to a dummy value so that in the next animation frame the system knows to recompute rotations (since even at same scrollY, the visual angles might need slight adjustment if aspect changed – though rotation logic is mostly geometric, but good to recalc).

Camera Field of View Adjustments: On very different screen sizes (mobile vs desktop), we may want to tweak the camera’s FOV or initial Z position so that pages remain appropriately sized on screen. For instance, on a small mobile screen, you might reduce FOV for less distortion or move camera closer/further. These can be conditional tweaks in the resize handler or initial setup.

CSS and Styling Considerations: We should ensure the body or container has a neutral background since pages might rotate and edges could show through gaps. For example, if pages have rounded corners or transparency, a background beneath (even the body’s background-color) will show. In a dark theme, body could be black so that when pages gap, we see black behind.

We also should ensure the CSS3DRenderer’s container does not introduce weird overflow. Setting overflow: visible on it is usually default, but just ensure nothing in CSS is clipping it.

High DPI or Zoom: CSS3DRenderer has a note that it only supports 100% browser zoom ￼. This typically isn’t a big problem, but be aware that if the user zooms the page, the alignment might break slightly. We assume default zoom for the experience to look correct.

Content Loading: If pages contain images or dynamic content that load after the initial script, their size might change. Since we base positions on pageHeight (which we took as window height for fullpage design), minor content growth (within the same viewport section) won’t affect spacing. But if a page’s content grows beyond one screen and you intended each page to be exactly one screen, you might need to decide how to handle overflow:
	•	Ideally, constrain each “page” content to fit in one screen for the effect.
	•	If not, the user might scroll within a page (which in our design just scrolls the whole scene, possibly mid-transition which is not intended). It’s recommended to design content per page that fits or use an internal scrollbar for that page’s content if absolutely necessary (but that complicates UX).
	•	If you must handle variable page heights, you could measure each page element’s height after loading and use those measurements instead of constant pageHeight. Then position each page accordingly (cumulative offsets). The scroll spacer height would be sum of all page heights. The rotation logic would need to be adjusted to use each page’s specific height as the interval for flipping. This is more complex but doable: instead of a uniform pageH, track an array of page start positions and lengths. Then find the current section based on scrollY. For this spec, we assume equal heights for simplicity.

Interactive Elements: Because we allow pointer events on the front-facing page, elements like links, buttons, and video players should work normally. One caveat: If using form inputs or iframes, they might not respond well to being in a CSS3D transformed element in some browsers (for example, some embedded video players might have CSS perspective quirks). In general, standard elements should be fine. Testing on multiple browsers is advisable, as CSS3D can sometimes have vendor-specific bugs (e.g. Safari’s handling of 3D transforms on video elements).

Performance Optimisation: The number of page elements should be kept reasonable. Each page is essentially a layer being transformed by the GPU. Modern browsers can handle dozens of such transformed elements, but if each page has heavy content (lots of images or videos), consider performance:
	•	Use will-change: transform; on the .rolodex-page CSS class to hint to the browser to promote these elements to their own layers (improving transform performance).
	•	If you have a very large number of pages, consider recycling off-screen pages. For example, pages far above or below could be removed from DOM or CSS3D scene and added back when needed. However, this complicates implementation and likely not needed unless N is huge.
	•	The rendering loop here is continuous (requestAnimationFrame). We do check for scroll changes to avoid heavy work when idle. Rendering the CSS3D scene even with no changes is relatively cheap (just repositioning the already transformed elements). If performance is an issue, we could further optimise by only calling cssRenderer.render on animation frames triggered by scroll events (and perhaps a timed continuation for momentum). But this adds complexity; in most cases, the simple loop at 60fps is fine.

Testing pointer events: It’s important to verify that you can scroll the page by mouse wheel or touch with this setup:
	•	Because the CSS3D container is fixed and pointer-events none, the wheel events should fall through to the underlying page (which is basically just the spacer). That will scroll the window as expected.
	•	Drag scrolling on touch should also work similarly.
	•	If any part of an interactive page (like an embedded map or scrollable mini-div) needs to capture scroll, that’s still possible because pointer events on the content div are enabled, so e.g. a scrollable element inside a page can still scroll internally. The rest of the page’s scroll will stop as usual when the pointer is over that element.
	•	We must ensure that when a page is tilted and effectively not visible, it doesn’t capture scroll accidentally. Our pointerEvents toggle logic should handle that (tilted pages get pointer-events none).

Sample Code Scaffold

Below is a simplified scaffold combining the steps above, demonstrating how one might initialise and tie everything together. This omits some checks and fine details for brevity but illustrates the flow:

import * as THREE from 'three';
import { CSS3DRenderer, CSS3DObject } from 'three/examples/jsm/renderers/CSS3DRenderer.js';

// Setup scene, camera, renderer
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(50, window.innerWidth/window.innerHeight, 0.1, 2000);
camera.position.set(0, 0, 800);
camera.lookAt(0, 0, 0);

const renderer = new CSS3DRenderer();
renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
renderer.domElement.style.position = 'fixed';
renderer.domElement.style.top = '0'; renderer.domElement.style.left = '0';
renderer.domElement.style.pointerEvents = 'none';
document.getElementById('three-container').appendChild(renderer.domElement);

// Create scroll group
const scrollGroup = new THREE.Group();
scene.add(scrollGroup);

// Gather pages and create CSS3DObjects
const pages = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.rolodex-page'));
const viewHeight = window.innerHeight;
pages.forEach((el, i) => {
  el.style.transformOrigin = '50% 100%';
  el.style.backfaceVisibility = 'hidden';
  el.style.transformStyle = 'preserve-3d';
  el.style.pointerEvents = 'auto';
  const obj = new CSS3DObject(el);
  obj.position.set(0, -viewHeight * i, 0);
  obj.rotation.x = (i === 0 ? 0 : -Math.PI/2);  // optional: start subsequent pages flat
  scrollGroup.add(obj);
});

// Add spacer for scroll height
const spacer = document.createElement('div');
spacer.style.height = (viewHeight * pages.length) + 'px';
spacer.style.background = 'transparent';
spacer.style.pointerEvents = 'none';
document.body.appendChild(spacer);

// Rotation update function
function updateRotations(scrollY) {
  const index = Math.floor(scrollY / viewHeight);
  const progress = (scrollY % viewHeight) / viewHeight;
  pages.forEach((_, j) => {
    const pageObj = scrollGroup.children[j];
    if (j < index) {
      pageObj.rotation.x = Math.PI/2;
    } else if (j === index) {
      pageObj.rotation.x = progress * (Math.PI/2);
    } else if (j === index + 1) {
      pageObj.rotation.x = -Math.PI/2 * (1 - progress);
    } else {
      pageObj.rotation.x = -Math.PI/2;
    }
    // Toggle pointer events for front-most page
    const isFacing = pageObj.rotation.x < 0.5; // ~< 30deg
    pageObj.element.style.pointerEvents = isFacing ? 'auto' : 'none';
  });
}

// Animation loop
let lastY = 0;
function animate() {
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  const scrollY = window.scrollY;
  if (scrollY !== lastY) {
    // move group to simulate scroll
    scrollGroup.position.y = scrollY;
    updateRotations(scrollY);
    lastY = scrollY;
  }
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
animate();

// Handle resize
window.addEventListener('resize', () => {
  renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
  camera.aspect = window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight;
  camera.updateProjectionMatrix();
  // update positions if view height changed
  const newH = window.innerHeight;
  if (Math.abs(newH - viewHeight) > 1) {
    // recalc each page position
    scrollGroup.children.forEach((obj, i) => {
      obj.position.y = - newH * i;
    });
    spacer.style.height = (newH * pages.length) + 'px';
  }
});

This scaffold code outlines the core logic:
	•	Initialising Three.js, CSS3DRenderer, and scene graph.
	•	Converting DOM pages to CSS3DObjects and stacking them.
	•	Using window.scrollY to adjust scrollGroup.position.y and page rotations.
	•	A render loop that continuously updates the scene.
	•	A basic pointer-events management for interactivity.
	•	Window resize adjustments.

In practice, you would integrate this into your app, possibly breaking it into modules (one for setting up 3D scene, one for controlling scroll/animation, etc.). Also, you might want to use requestAnimationFrame only when needed (e.g., via an onscroll event that then triggers a few rAF updates during momentum), but the always-on approach is simpler and typically fine.

Performance Considerations

Achieving smooth performance (60 FPS) with this effect requires careful consideration of how many elements are transformed and how heavy they are:
	•	GPU Acceleration: By using CSS 3D transforms, modern browsers will offload the page elements to the GPU. Ensure each page element is not too large in terms of pixel area or complexity. Applying will-change: transform to .rolodex-page in CSS is recommended to hint GPU compositing.
	•	Limit Simultaneous Motion: In our design, typically only two pages are animating (rotating) at any given scroll position. Others remain static (either flat or upright). This limits the workload. The translation of the whole group is a single transform on the parent, which is cheap.
	•	Content Complexity: If a page contains a video or canvas, the browser can handle it, but remember that rotating a video might cause some additional overhead (and some browsers might not like heavy video in a 3D transform). Test with sample content and consider using poster images or lighter elements if performance suffers.
	•	Memory Management: The CSS3DRenderer will keep the DOM elements in the DOM tree. There isn’t a typical memory leak issue as long as you don’t keep adding pages without removing. If pages are added/removed dynamically (say via AJAX), ensure to remove the CSS3DObject from scene and the element from the renderer’s DOM when a page is removed.
	•	Scroll Jank: Because we’re not intercepting the scroll, we rely on the browser’s smooth scroll. Our JS runs on each frame to update transforms. It’s important this update is efficient. The calculations here are straightforward math and should be fine. Avoid doing anything heavy in the scroll loop (like querying DOM layouts or forcing reflows). We set pointerEvents in the loop which could affect layout, but since it’s a binary change and the structure is simple, it’s usually okay. We might instead pre-assign classes and only change class names to minimize style recalculation.
	•	requestAnimationFrame vs onscroll: onscroll events can fire frequently and not necessarily at a synced frame rate, leading to potential missed frames if the work inside is heavy. Our approach of using rAF ensures we tie updates to the browser’s rendering cycle. We check window.scrollY each frame. This is typically fine. If needed, we could throttle or debounce scroll events to trigger the rAF loop, but given our small workload, it’s acceptable to just let it run continuously.
	•	Edge-case: Fast scrolling or resize mid-scroll: If the user flings scrolling or uses spacebar/PgDown to jump quickly, our logic should still handle it – the math doesn’t assume small increments, it will calculate correct rotations even for large jumps. If anything, extremely fast scrolling could skip some intermediate frames, but the final positions will be correct. There might be a slight visual jump if the user somehow scrolls faster than frames can update, but that’s usually not perceivable. In case of extremely tall pages and very fast scroll devices, one might consider using an IntersectionObserver or calculations to determine current page without iterating every frame, but our math with index and progress covers it directly.
	•	Mobile performance: On mobile devices, CSS transforms are generally efficient. The biggest performance consideration is memory and layers. Each page might become a separate layer. If you have dozens of full-screen layers, on low-end devices that could consume memory. Monitor memory usage if this is a concern. If needed, you can remove far-off pages from the DOM. For example, if user is on page 5, pages 0-3 could be removed and re-added if they scroll back up. But implementing that requires careful state management.
	•	Testing: It’s advisable to test on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and devices. Pay special attention to:
	•	Safari (iOS): Sometimes needs -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; -webkit-transform-style: preserve-3d; prefixed CSS for the page elements for smooth rendering.
	•	Firefox: Ensure the transform origin is working as expected (older Firefox had quirks with transform-origin on 3D elements, but modern versions are fine).
	•	Edge/Chrome: Usually fine, but test pointer events layering especially if using any additional overlays.

Edge Cases and Additional Notes
	•	Resizing and Orientation Changes: We covered window resizing, but on devices that can rotate (mobile/tablet), ensure that switching from portrait to landscape reflows the pages correctly. The code recalculates pageHeight and repositioning; this should cover it. Just be mindful that if using 100vh in CSS, some mobile browsers have issues with the URL bar, so reading window.innerHeight is a safer measure for JS (which we do).
	•	Scroll Restoration: If the user reloads or navigates away and back (especially on mobile), the browser might restore the last scroll position. Our script should handle an initial scrollY not at 0. The animate loop as written will take whatever window.scrollY is and apply it. So if a user refreshes mid-way, it should still display the correct page partially flipped. Just ensure the page elements are all in correct initial rotation states for that scroll (the code sets them in updateRotations immediately once animate runs).
	•	No JavaScript / Fallback: In a scenario where JS is disabled, our approach would not show content, since we remove pages into the 3D scene and rely on JS. A possible graceful degradation is to leave the original DOM pages in place (for no-script) and only activate this script if JS is enabled. If needed, you could clone nodes for CSS3D and keep originals hidden, or simply accept that without JS the Rolodex effect (and maybe the content) won’t be available. This depends on project requirements.
	•	Combining WebGL content: If later, you want to add actual 3D meshes or shaders behind the pages (e.g. a fancy background or additional 3D effects), you can add a standard WebGLRenderer. You would then render the CSS3D scene, then the WebGL scene, or vice versa, to composite. Typically, you render the CSS3D scene, then render the WebGL scene with transparency so that the DOM elements appear on top (or do the opposite with careful z-index management as seen in forum discussions). Keep in mind, as noted earlier, true depth interleaving isn’t possible (a CSS3DObject will always either be in front or behind the WebGL canvas – no partial occlusion ￼). For our use case (pages over a background), you’d likely render the WebGL scene as a background (with CSS3DRenderer’s domElement on top of the canvas).
	•	SEO and Accessibility: Because the content is still in the DOM as regular elements, it remains accessible to screen readers and indexable by search engines. Using CSS3D doesn’t change the semantic structure of your content – a great advantage over purely canvas solutions. Ensure to preserve any ARIA attributes or semantic tags in your page markup. Also, test keyboard navigation if needed: one concern is that if an element is rotated out or off-screen, a focus might still reach it. You might manage focus by scripting (e.g., focus on next page’s container when flipping, etc.) or by using tabindex="-1" on offscreen pages.
	•	Backface Visibility: We set backface-visibility: hidden to avoid seeing a mirrored reverse of content. If you wanted a double-sided page (for example, showing a back side of a card), you could remove that and style the back separately (by adding a child element that is rotated 180° around Y, etc.). But typically for a Rolodex, we just hide the back since only front content matters.
	•	Responsiveness of Content: Each page’s content can be styled with relative units or media queries as usual. The CSS3D transformation won’t break that. Just remember that extremely long content on one page may break the effect; it’s better to split content into multiple pages if it exceeds one screen, to keep the interaction intuitive.
	•	Debugging Tips: During development, it can be helpful to:
	•	Add a slight semi-transparent color to pages so you can see the overlap during flips.
	•	Log current scroll and rotations to fine-tune the timing of the flip.
	•	Temporarily reduce motion by scaling down the rotation angles or using a fixed scroll increment to inspect states.
	•	Use dev tools to inspect the structure: CSS3DRenderer will create a hierarchy of divs inside #three-container. Each CSS3DObject’s element will be a child with heavy transform: matrix3d(...) applied. It can be hard to parse, but if something isn’t appearing, ensure the element is indeed appended there and not with display:none or off somewhere unexpectedly.

By following this specification, the outcome will be a robust 3D Rolodex interface: as the user scrolls, pages will smoothly flip in 3D space while maintaining all the original content and interactions. The look and feel of the original design will be preserved, but with added depth and flair from the 3D flip animation. This approach leverages Three.js for the heavy lifting of 3D transforms on DOM elements ￼, all while keeping user experience enhancements like native scrolling behaviour and interactive content support at the forefront.
